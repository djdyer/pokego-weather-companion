## Description

Using both the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) & The [Pokemon Go Stats / Type API](https://pokemon-go1.p.rapidapi.com), PokeGo Weather Companion will collect a users' valid city input, provide today's weather along with a list of Pokemone currently boosted in current conditions.
